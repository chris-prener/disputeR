Description: A number of packages exist to implement unit tests, either
    generally within R or specifically for functions. Most of these packages 
    take a similar approach, providing users a framework with which they can 
    write their own validation tests. In contrast, 'disputeR' provides
    pre-written sets of tests that can be easily added to functions or Shiny
    modules with minimal additional code. These tests return informative 
    error messages that follow the 'tidyverse' style guide's recommendations.
